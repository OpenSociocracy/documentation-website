# Why Open Source?

Without being preachy, open source is about freedom and protection.

* Freedom to change and extend it as you want.
* Protection from having it taken away.

## Freedom

If our product doesn't do what you want you can fork it and do as you please, subject to [license](https://github.com/OpenSociocracy/open-sociocracy-saas/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Protection

If you use a hosted OpenSociocracy solution you may think that open source doesn't matter, but it does. If the host is unable to provide adequate service, you can easily move to another OpenSociocracy host, or [self-host](https://handbook.opensociocracy.org/self-hosting/).

## Social Good

There is also the element of social good. By using OpenSociocracy you help support open source developers, this helps ensure that others can experience those same freedoms and protections.
