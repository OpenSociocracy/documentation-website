# OpenSociocracy FAQ

## Does Sociocracy scale?

The short answer is yes, with the caveat that there are situations where it doesn't work well. Thee are no perfect solutions and nobody is suggesting you can't implement other tools where appropriate. Sociocracy can fit the vast majortity of real-world use cases.

A lot of it depends on how you define `scale`. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPgm53QDU3c) does a great job of explaining it.
