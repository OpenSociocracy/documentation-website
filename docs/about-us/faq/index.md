# OpenSociocracy FAQ

## Does Sociocracy scale?

The short answer is yes, with the caveat that there are situations where it doesn't work well. Thee are no perfect solutions and nobody is suggesting you can't implement other tools where appropriate. Sociocracy can fit the vast majortity of real-world use cases.

A lot of it depends on how you define `scale`. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPgm53QDU3c) does a great job of explaining it.

## Where can I get help?

We realize our [Sociocracy quick starts](/quick-start/) and [web app](https://logbook.opensociocracy.org) aren't always enough. For those situations the community has a variety of [consulting services](/resources/sociocracy-consulting-services/). 

## How does Sociocracy differ from Holocracy, etc.?

The OSP will surface both Sociocratic methods and methods that might seem more applicable in a Holocracy product, that's part of the "Open" in "OpenSociocracy". We're open to introducing options where it makes sense.
