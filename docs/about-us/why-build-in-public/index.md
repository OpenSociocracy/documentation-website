# Why Build in Public?

We are not sociocracy experts, but we are development professionals with enough experise to know that we bridge the gap with outside resources. We're currently going through own own pains to implement sociocracy but know that collecting a variety of user stories will lead to a better product. 

We'll share our pains and our success as we go along.
