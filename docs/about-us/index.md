# The OpenSociocracy Project

We want to create [open source](/why-use-open-source/) S3 tools using S3 practices and a "[build in public](/why-build-in-public/)" process.

## Project History

The project was started May 1 2023 by [Brian Winkers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bwinkers/) to make it easier to use S3 in software projects.
