# The OpenSociocracy Project

The OpenSociocracy project was started May 1, 2023 by developers at a small tech co-op that were struggling get their own internal Sociocracy projects kicked off. We're releasing the code as [open source](/about-us/why-use-open-source/) and developing the product using a [build in public](/about-us/why-build-in-public/) process.

It is an all volunteer effort, the developers are donating their time and hosting resources.
