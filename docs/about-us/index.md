# The OpenSociocracy Project

We want to create [open source](/why-use-open-source/) Sociocracy tools using Sociocracy practices and a "[build in public](/why-build-in-public/)" process.  The project was started May 1 2023 by [Brian Winkers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bwinkers/) to make it easier to use Sociocracy in software projects.

## Who we are

[Brian Winkers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bwinkers/) has been the primary architect and builder of multiple web applications for ISP, telcos, financial institutions, government agencies, manufacturing companies and ecommerce startups. He has always released his personal projects as open source.

[Will Stedden](https://will.stedden.org) likes to work on lots of things.  His passions for economic democracy and getting stuff done made Open Sociocracy seem like a great project to support.
