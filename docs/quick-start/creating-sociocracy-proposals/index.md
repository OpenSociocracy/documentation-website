# Create a Proposal 

A proposal is the first step in reaching an informed consensus, and involving the team in the proposal process surfaces potential issues sooner. Team members can support a proposal better when they understand what was and wasn't included, and why.

**Steps:**

1. Agree on the primary driver
2. Define dimensions or aspects of the problem
3. Collect ideas and solutions
4. Formulate a proposal

The short video at the bottom of this [article on proposals](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/participatory-proposal-writing/) is a good starting point. You can copy our template below to create a proposals logbook. The spreadsheet used by the OpenSociocracy team is provided as well.
