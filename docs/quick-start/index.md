# Kickstart Your Sociocracy Efforts

Use these quick starts to launch your sociocracy projects.

* Define how you will track or log your activities.
* Get a baseline understanding of drivers and domains.
* Iterate through proposals, decisions and agreements.
* Check your progress with periodic peer reviews.

## Keep a Logbook - Build on Your Efforts

If you don't track and organize your activities you won't be able to improve the process or measure its value. It is ok to start with a simple solution while you determine the people and processes that will be used. We provide free logbook templates to get you started.

## Defining Drivers - Understanding WHY 

In Sociocracy, like life, it is important to know what **drives** your actions. If you don't understand why you are making proposals, decisions and agreements the quality will suffer. Expect your driver definitions to change as you better understand your situation.

## Define Domains - Structure Your Organization

Traditional organizations structures don't always represent where power is and influence flows. Use sociocracy circles and domains to better understand the true relations within your organization. The smaller your organization is, the easier this will be.
