# Kickstart Your Sociocracy Efforts

The guides below help you get up and running with Sociocracy.

## Keep a Logbook - Build on Your Efforts

Logbooks store all information relevant for running an organization and its teams. The logbook is accessible to all members of an organization, and information is kept confidential only when needed.

We provide free logbook templates to get you started.

## Define Domains - Structure Your Organization

Organizational structure defines where power is located, and how influence flows. A domain is a distinct area of influence, activity and decision-making within an organization. It has a delegator, responsibile for a domain and individuals to whom the domain is delegated (delagatees).

This quick start provides spreadsheets and canvas templates to help in defining your domains, delagators and delgatees. You can then use [Circle Builder](/circle-builder/) to create organizational diagrams.
