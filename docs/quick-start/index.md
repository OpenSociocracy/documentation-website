# Kickstart Your Sociocracy Efforts

Use these quick starts to launch your Sociocracy projects.

* Define how you will track or log your activities.
* Get a baseline understanding of drivers and domains.
* Iterate through proposals, decisions and agreements.
* Check your progress with periodic peer reviews.

## Keep a Logbook - Build on Your Efforts

If you don't track and organize your activities you won't be able to improve the process or measure its value. It is ok to start with a simple solution while you determine the people and processes that will be used. We provide free logbook templates to get you started.

## Define Domains - Structure Your Organization

Organizational structure defines where power is located, and how influence flows. A domain is a distinct area of influence, activity and decision-making within an organization. It has a delegator, responsibile for a domain and individuals to whom the domain is delegated (delagatees).

This quick start provides spreadsheets and canvas templates to help in defining your domains, delagators and delgatees. You can then use [Circle Builder](/circle-builder/) to create organizational diagrams.
