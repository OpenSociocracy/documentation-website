## Create Proposals using Sociocracy

A well-formed proposal provides the foundation for informed decision-making. You are already creating proposals in emails or tickets, sociocracy helps formalize the process, with a human touch. We have documents and spreadsheets to help you create effective proposals, with minimal effort.

## Make Decisions with Consent

Consent decision making improves the speed, quality and acceptance of the decsions. Implementing a more formalized process helps people focus on using the tools, and not defining them.

## Form Agreements using Sociocracy

Agreements ensure that decisions have impact. An agreement details who will do what to make that decision a reality. These agreements will lead to proposals, starting the process again.

## Use Peer Reviews to Self-Manage Teams

Check your progress and effectiveness using peer reviews. The sociocracy process can take some of the sting out of peer reviews.
