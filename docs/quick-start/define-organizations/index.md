# Definining Organizations.

Using Sociocracy 3.0 helps you figure out how to meet your organizationâ€™s biggest challenges, identify and respond effectively to the opportunities you face, and create the most value you can with the limited time, energy and resources you have available.

You can use our [excercise](/quick-start/define-organizations/s3-organizations-team-excercise/) to fill out an [Organization Canvas](https://s3canvas.sociocracy30.org/pdf/s3-organization-canvas.pdf) and [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uIB5RZXWxsrXSBqylEU2hYgp2rDwoXnXFD7qgBBWHuM/edit?usp=sharing) to easily creat an [organizational diagram](/quick-start/define-organizations/organization-circles-app/).
