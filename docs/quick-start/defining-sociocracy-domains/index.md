# Define Domains 

Using Sociocracy 3.0 helps you figure out how to meet your organizationâ€™s biggest challenges, identify and respond effectively to the opportunities you face, and create the most value you can with the limited time, energy and resources you have available.

## Structure Your Organization

You can use our [exercise](/quick-start/defining-s3-organization-domains/s3-organizations-team-exercise/) to fill out an [Organization Canvas](https://s3canvas.sociocracy30.org/pdf/s3-organization-canvas.pdf) and [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uIB5RZXWxsrXSBqylEU2hYgp2rDwoXnXFD7qgBBWHuM/edit?usp=sharing) to easily create an [organizational diagram](/quick-start/defining-s3-organization-domains/s3-circle-builder/) using [Circle Builder](/circle-builder/).

If you are past the quick start phase or it isn't working for you, reach out in our [learning community](https://community.sociocracy30.org/) or consider taking a [Sociocracy 3.0 Academy](https://academy.sociocracy30.org/) course.

To help organize your sociocracy documents and relate them to domains and drivers we suggest our very own [Logbook](https://logbook.opensociocracy.org).
