# Define Domains 

Using Sociocracy helps you figure out how to meet challenges, and create value with the limited time, energy and resources.

## Structure Your Organization

Start by using the [S3 Canvases](https://s3canvas.sociocracy30.org/) to help you think about your [organization](https://s3canvas.sociocracy30.org/s3-organization-canvas.html), the [team](https://s3canvas.sociocracy30.org/s3-team-canvas.html) and how things are [delegated](https://s3canvas.sociocracy30.org/s3-delegation-canvas.html). The canvases help view the pieces as a whole.

Once you feel you've captured the essence of you organization in those canvases you can use that information to fill out our spreadsheets. Collaborating in the spreadsheets, while referencing the canvas documentation may be the most effective route for remote teams.
