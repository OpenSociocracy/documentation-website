# Defining Business Drivers

A [driver](/glossary/#driver) is what casues us to act. It is useful to phrase it as "what is happening" and "what is needed". Drivers may be internal or external, below are some examples of each. Your drivers may also come from the intersection of these. 

#### Internal Business Drivers

* People
* Profit
* Assets
* Growth
* Expenses

#### External Business Drivers

* Competitorsâ€™ activities
* Customer demand
* The price of commodities or resources
* Legislation and government policy
* Litigation

To get started we suggest defining the organizations top drivers. This will enable you to tie your other activities back to those. When starting out, it is ok if you can't define them. They may be easier to define as they come up in context. 

To write those, think about:

* What **happened** to create the situation?

* What new **needs** have arisen?

* What **changes** need to be made?


## OpenSociocracy Drivers

In the spirit of openness and sharing we provide access to our project's internal documents. We keep the organization current primary drivers in a Google Doc.
