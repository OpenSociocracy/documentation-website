# Helping OpenSociocracy Grow

We want to create a product having a 360 degree view of the requirements, to gain that we need S3 experts as well as end users. 

To help, join our [build in public Discord channel](https://discord.gg/seExDy6M). 

We'll be using a [build in public](/about-us/why-build-in-public/) process using S3 practices where can. We'll openly share the team's experiences with using S3 to build S3 tools, the process and meetings will be shared in public. Everything will be avilable as open source or CC BY-SA as approropriate.

The community will define how we move forwards. We plan on using many small iterations, so even if you can't help define things up front, you can help with it moving forwards.
